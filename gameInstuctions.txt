For my final project in CS 491 I will be using a game that mixes 
tic-tac-toe with rummy. The game uses a 2D-array for both rummy 
and tic-tac-toe. The game is a single player game for simplicity 
that uses a 32 card deck with 4 suits “HR”, “DM”, “CL”, “SP”. 
The values of the cards are 2-9. A valid example of the 2D-array 
would be [DM,9]. There are a few ways to win the game.

• Simple set, 10 points: all cards on a row/column/diagonal 
on the board must have the same suit (can have different face values).
 Examples of two simple sets are ["CL", 8], ["CL", 5], ["CL", 7] 
 and ["HR", 8], ["HR", 3], ["HR", 6].

• Set, 15 points: all cards on a row/column/diagonal on the 
board must have the same face value (can have different suits). 
Two sample sets can be as follows: ["HR", 3], ["DM", 3], ["SP", 3] 
and ["DM", 8], ["SP", 8], ["CL", 8].

• Simple run, 20 points: all cards on a row/column/diagonal on 
the board must have consecutive face values either in the increasing 
or decreasing order (can have different suits). For example ["SP", 2], 
["DM", 3], ["CL", 4] and ["CL", 6], ["CL", 5], ["DM", 4] are 
simple runs.

• Run, 25 points: Cards on a row/column/diagonal on the board must 
have the same suit and consecutive face values either in the 
increasing or decreasing order. Examples of runs are ["SP", 2], 
["SP", 3], ["SP", 4] and ["CL", 6], ["CL", 5], ["CL, 4].
